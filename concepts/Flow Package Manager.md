## **Flow Package Manager** 

### **Purpose**

FPM is the single gateway for installing, updating, and managing all modular components within the Flow ecosystem — from system kernels to language adapters.  
 It acts as a **declarative trust and provisioning layer**, combining version control, dependency resolution, digital signatures, and lineage tracking under the same schema.

---

### **1\. Scope of FPM**

FPM manages everything FlowOS can execute or reference:

| Package Type | Examples | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **System Packages** | FlowDirector, FlowGuard, FlowLog | Core OS subsystems |
| **Language Adapters** | flowdata\_python, flowdata\_cpp | Data conversion modules |
| **ActionBlocks** | sort.list, compress.file | Function libraries |
| **CommBlocks** | mqtt.connector, http.client | Communication handlers |
| **DriverBlocks** | nvme.driver, usb.audio | Hardware interface logic |
| **FlowScripts** | workflows, boot scripts | Declarative programs |
| **KernelScripts** | desktop.kernel, iot.kernel | Boot configurations |
| **NanoPackages** | edge.telemetry | IoT or embedded bundles |
| **Company Packages (FlowCorp)** | department.analytics, security.audit | Internal deployments |

Every package, regardless of origin, is standardized under the `.flowpkg` format.

---

### **2\. Package Structure**

Each `.flowpkg` is a signed, compressed directory:

`<package_name>-<version>.flowpkg/`  
`│`  
`├── manifest.yaml`  
`├── package.sig`  
`├── payload/`  
`│   ├── files, scripts, or blocks`  
`│   └── resources/`  
`├── dependencies.yaml`  
`├── schema.flow.json`  
`└── changelog.md`

#### **manifest.yaml**

Describes identity and compatibility:

`package: flowdata_python`  
`version: 1.2.0`  
`type: language_adapter`  
`flow_version: ">=1.0"`  
`compatibility: ["FlowOS", "FlowDirector"]`  
`author: flowregistry.io`  
`checksum: sha256:fe23a1...`  
`license: MIT`  
`description: >`  
  `Converts Python data structures into FlowData Schema.`

#### **package.sig**

Cryptographic signature generated by FlowGuard at packaging time.  
 Contains certificate chain and signing context.

---

### **3\. FPM Command Model**

Commands mirror the structure of modern declarative managers, but integrate deeply with FlowOS systems.

| Command | Function | FlowOS Integration |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `fpm install <pkg>` | Installs a package | FlowGuard validates → FlowLog records |
| `fpm update <pkg>` | Upgrades package safely | FlowDirector reloads runtime |
| `fpm remove <pkg>` | Uninstalls package | Logs change and re-signs state |
| `fpm verify <pkg>` | Confirms integrity | Uses FlowGuard \+ FlowDNA |
| `fpm list` | Lists installed packages | Pulls from DataSystem inventory |
| `fpm rollback <pkg>@<ver>` | Restores old version | Uses DataBlock deltas |
| `fpm mirror sync` | Syncs from FlowRegistry | FlowCorp uses local caching |
| `fpm audit` | Lists trust and signature state | Generates FlowLog compliance report |

All commands route through FlowDirector’s permission and policy APIs.

---

### **4\. Package Lifecycle**

1. **Fetch:** FPM requests package metadata from FlowRegistry or a configured mirror.

2. **Verify:** FlowGuard checks digital signature and schema compatibility.

3. **Deploy:** FlowDirector installs payload into proper subsystem (ActionSystem, DataSystem, etc.).

4. **Log:** FlowLog records the transaction, including checksum, signer, and manifest snapshot.

5. **Health Check:** FlowGuard runs immediate and delayed integrity tests.

6. **Rollup:** DataSystem archives the installation event as a delta story.

---

### **5\. FPM Repositories**

FPM operates with three repository types:

| Repository | Example | Access | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **FlowRegistry** | registry.flowos.net | Read-only | Global trusted repository |
| **FlowCorp Mirror** | corp.local/fpm | Read/Write | Internal cache \+ policy control |
| **User Sandbox** | \~/.flowos/packages | Read/Write | Local testing or development |

Mirrors synchronize through cryptographic rollups (`FlowSig Rollup`), ensuring package lineage and provenance are preserved.

---

### **6\. Integration with FlowGuard**

FlowGuard provides:

* Signature validation for `.flowpkg` files

* Trust scoring per package (Certified, Internal, Untrusted)

* Quarantine for unsafe or deprecated packages

* Scheduled key rotation and integrity sweeps

Each FPM transaction triggers FlowGuard to:

* Verify checksum

* Record source trust level

* Generate or update trust ledger entry

* Write verification results to FlowLog

---

### **7\. Integration with FlowLog**

Every FPM operation is a **first-class event** in FlowLog.

Example entry:

`timestamp: 2025-10-23T11:00Z`  
`actor: sysadmin@flowcorp`  
`action: install`  
`package: flowdata_python`  
`version: 1.2.0`  
`trust_level: certified`  
`checksum: sha256:fe23a1...`  
`result: success`  
`signature: 8a92b3...`

FlowLog supports three verbosity levels: Narrative, Hybrid, and Full Transcript.

---

### **8\. Integration with FlowDirector**

FlowDirector uses FPM to:

* Resolve component dependencies dynamically.

* Load and unload Blocks or Actions as needed.

* Trigger rollback if a package fails runtime verification.

* Access manifest metadata for runtime context.

Essentially, FlowDirector treats FPM as its **software metabolism** — the mechanism for ingesting and replacing functional units safely.

---

### **9\. Integration with FlowCorp**

In a corporate deployment:

* The **FlowCorp FPM Mirror** serves as the local package ecosystem.

* Departmental admins can publish or promote packages (e.g., internal ActionBlocks).

* Organizational policies define allowed sources (public, partner, internal).

* The **Company DataSystem** tracks usage metrics and update cadence.

* **Company HealthSystem** can correlate update churn with morale or reliability metrics.

This unifies system health, cybersecurity, and organizational performance under one framework.

---

### **10\. Versioning & Lineage**

FPM leverages FlowDNA (hash signatures) and DataBlock deltas:

* Each version stores a snapshot in the DataSystem.

* Rollbacks simply re-activate older DataBlocks.

* Historical lineage is always reconstructable.

Version format follows semantic convention:  
 `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>-<trust>`

Example:

`1.4.2-78-certified`  
`1.4.2-79-internal`

---

### **11\. FlowDNA Integration**

Each `.flowpkg` embeds a `FlowDNA.sig` — a condensed signature of its contents, dependencies, and environment.  
 On installation, FlowGuard merges this with the system’s DNA tree, updating the overall signature lineage.

This enables any FlowOS node to reconstruct its software ancestry with a single command:

`fpm lineage --full`

---

### **12\. IoT and Edge Compatibility**

FPM supports a **Lite Mode** for NanoFlow and EdgeDirector deployments:

* Differential updates only (delta packages)

* Offline caching and deferred verification

* Minimal FlowGuard footprint

* Optional external verification via parent node

This allows IoT devices to stay secure without permanent connectivity.

---

### **13\. Example Workflow**

**Goal:** Add Java adapter to existing FlowData system.

`fpm install flowdata_java`  
`→ FlowGuard verifying signature...`  
`→ Installing to /system/adapters/`  
`→ FlowDirector linking adapter registry...`  
`→ FlowLog entry written.`  
`→ Success: flowdata_java v1.0.4 installed.`

---

### **14\. Summary**

FPM unifies every Flow subsystem under a single provisioning pipeline:

**FlowRegistry (Global)** → **FlowCorp Mirror (Org)** → **FlowDirector (Runtime)** → **FlowLog (Record)** → **FlowGuard (Trust)**

It’s the backbone of distribution, the connective tissue between developers, administrators, and the operating framework.
