# FlowLog-App 

**Unified Logging and Audit Trail for Flowgramming Applications**

---

**Purpose:**  
 FlowLog-App is the application-level logging and auditing system for all non-OS components in the Flowgramming ecosystem. It serves as the single source of truth for tracking the execution of FlowScripts, interactions between Blocks, suite-wide behavior, and detected security anomalies.

It is paired with FlowGuard-App and FlowDirector to provide real-time insight, historical traceability, and post-mortem analysis.

**Core Functions:**

1. **Script-Level Logging**

   * Records every execution of a FlowScript, including:

     * Script name, origin, hash/signature

     * Timestamp of start/end

     * Trust level at time of execution

     * Input/Output DataBlocks and ActionBlocks used

     * ActionTags applied

2. **Block Interactions and Communication Events**

   * Logs communication attempts and results between:

     * DataBlocks

     * ActionBlocks

     * CommBlocks

     * Any other supported Block types

   * Identifies comm routing paths and anomalies (e.g., rerouted flows, dropped packets)

3. **Suite Logging (FlowSuites)**

   * Associates all related FlowScripts under a single **Correlation ID**.

   * Tracks:

     * Sequence and timing of script activations

     * Shared DataBlock usage

     * SessionBlock activity

     * Failover events, fallback paths, and overrides

   * Interfaces with FlowGuard-App for suite-level alerts and responses

4. **Trust and Security Event Logging**

   * Records violations flagged by FlowGuard-App:

     * Trust policy failures

     * Quarantine decisions

     * Runtime anomalies

     * Forced halts, reroutes, or rollbacks

   * Captures sandbox status of Blocks

   * Stores reference to original FlowScript and Block versions for traceability

5. **Standardized Format and Export Support**

   * Logs are stored in a modular, nested structure that supports:

     * Local or remote querying

     * Filtering by timestamp, FlowScript, Block, Action, or Trust Event

     * Export in JSON, CSV, or streaming log feeds

   * API-compatible with third-party monitoring and incident response tools

6. **Developer and AI Tooling Support**

   * Annotations available to help developers debug and revise FlowScripts

   * Integration with the ActionSystem to explain failures and suggest replacements

   * Enables AI companions to monitor script behavior and flag inefficiencies

---

**Security Considerations:**

* Only FlowDirector and FlowGuard-App may write to the canonical FlowLog-App

* Blocks may expose supplemental logs, but cannot modify the canonical entry

* Logs may be mirrored for forensic analysis or compliance storage

---

**Future Extensions:**

* Signature-based attestation for log bundles

* Blockchain integration for immutable audit trails

* Cross-device or federated FlowLog coordination

---

FlowLog-App enables transparency, security, and system-level observability within the Flowgramming paradigm. It provides the foundation for intelligent automation, developer insight, and post-event forensics.
