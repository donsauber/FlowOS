**SessionBlocks and SessionSystem**

**Transient State Containers for Flowgramming**

---

**Purpose:**  
 SessionBlocks represent temporary, in-process state and scoped runtime memory for FlowScripts and FlowSuites. Unlike persistent DataBlocks, SessionBlocks are ephemeral, sandboxed, and directly controlled by the FlowDirector. They enable modular scripts to track logic-specific state, share transient memory, and coordinate across distributed or load-balanced workflows.

The SessionSystem manages creation, scoping, inheritance, and teardown of all SessionBlocks in the runtime environment.

---

**Key Characteristics of SessionBlocks:**

* **Volatile**: Exist only during script/suite execution unless explicitly persisted.

* **Sandboxed**: Isolated from other blocks unless shared by script design.

* **Scoped**: Tied to a single FlowScript, SuiteScript, or FlowBlock unless shared by reference.

* **Secure**: Monitored by FlowGuard-App for anomalies, misuse, or data leaks.

---

**Use Cases:**

* Storing script-local variables and counters (e.g., loop counts, flags).

* Managing retry attempts or fallback state.

* Sharing state between layers of a FlowSuite.

* Passing ephemeral tokens or identity across CommBlocks.

* Handling input/output state in long-lived ActionBlocks.

---

**SessionBlock Types:**

* **Private**: Only available to the creating FlowScript.

* **Shared**: Accessible to a defined set of FlowBlocks or Suite layers.

* **Inherited**: Passed from parent FlowScript to child (controlled by FlowDirector).

* **Forked**: Cloned for parallel processing threads with separation.

---

**Security and Lifecycle Rules:**

* Always created and destroyed by the **FlowDirector**.

* Cannot spawn or modify other Blocks.

* All writes and reads are logged via **FlowLog-App**.

* Default timeout or lifespan tied to FlowScript execution.

* Can be wiped, sealed, or quarantined mid-execution.

* Cannot persist beyond scope without explicit FlowScript elevation.

---

**SessionSystem Functions:**

* Allocates and maps SessionBlocks at script launch.

* Handles inheritance, forking, and secure linking of Sessions.

* Validates access controls on shared/forked SessionBlocks.

* Detects and halts memory leaks or recursion exploits.

* Coordinates memory usage across multi-Block processes.

---

**Integration Points:**

* **FlowDirector**: Orchestrates SessionBlock lifecycle.

* **FlowGuard-App**: Scans for misuse or anomalies.

* **FlowLog-App**: Logs SessionBlock creation, mutation, and resolution.

* **ActionBlocks**: Use SessionBlocks for in-memory temporary storage.

* **CommBlocks**: May pass SessionBlock references between distributed Blocks (if permitted).

* **SuiteScripts**: Manage shared or persistent Session state for long-running tasks.

---

**Future Extensions:**

* Session snapshotting for debugging and replay.

* Session-based rollback checkpoints.

* Graph-based session memory visualization.

* Live tracing across FlowSuite layers.

SessionBlocks formalize ephemeral computation as a first-class element in Flowgramming, enabling clean, observable, and secure state management across modular, distributed workflows.
