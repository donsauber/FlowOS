# FlowDirector  
**Central Execution and Oversight Engine for FlowScripts**

---

## Purpose

The **FlowDirector** is the system-level component responsible for executing and supervising FlowScripts, managing the lifecycle of all FlowBlocks (Data, Comm, Action, Library, etc.), and ensuring secure, traceable behavior through its integrated security layer: **FlowGuard-App**.  

It acts as the runtime, scheduler, and contract validator for the entire Flowgramming environment outside the OS layer.

---

## Core Responsibilities

### FlowScript Execution
- Loads, validates, and begins execution of FlowScripts.  
- Manages instantiation and teardown of all Blocks described in the script.  
- Supports both specific and general Action calls.  
- Supports FlowScript Adverbs (Action Tags) and enforces behavioral modifiers.  
- Enforces strict vs. flexible Action selection modes.  

---

### Block Lifecycle Management
Tracks each Block spawned by a FlowScript and manages:

- Communication routing via CommBlocks  
- Memory and CPU allocation for ActionBlocks  
- Data linkage and versioning for DataBlocks  
- Performs cleanup and sandbox teardown when a FlowScript ends or is terminated.  

---

### FlowGuard-App (Embedded)
- Validates ActionBlocks, CommBlocks, and LibraryBlocks before activation.  
- Logs all policy violations, security alerts, and permission overreach attempts.  
- Applies trust scores, origin tracing, and behavioral monitoring on runtime Blocks.  
- Can quarantine or shut down malicious or unstable Blocks and report them to FlowLog-App.  

---

### FlowLog-App Integration
- Every major FlowScript action, Block instantiation, failure, or override is logged.  
- All FlowGuard decisions are recorded with correlation tokens.  
- Logs can be exported or forwarded to central audit servers.  

---

### Adaptive Execution Engine
- Supports sandboxed execution for untrusted scripts or Actions.  
- Can increase parallelism (threads) inside a Block as demand increases.  
- Adapts thread count and Block behavior to optimize throughput and load balance.  

---

### Script Evolution Support
- Annotates failed or adjusted FlowScript executions with metadata.  
- Allows for retry logic, fallback ActionBlocks, or alternate execution paths.  
- Can apply auto-healing logic to replace failed or suboptimal Blocks based on history.  

---

### Inter-System Communication
- Talks to the CommSystem to handle networking APIs, device links, and I/O.  
- Can request services from OSDirector for hardware access via DriverBlocks.  
- Can interact with ActionSystem, DataSystem, and LibrarySystem to orchestrate resource usage.  

---

## FlowDirector Trust and Safety Features

- **FlowGuard-App** is required and always active.  
- No Block may spawn a new Block outside of its FlowScript bounds.  
- All Blocks operate inside default sandboxes unless marked trusted.  
- Action Tags (Adverbs) are validated before execution.  
- All violations, conflicts, and adaptive changes are logged.  

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Build FlowScript interpreter (supporting Action Tags and Block schemas).  
2. Implement FlowGuard-Appâ€™s trust scoring and quarantine API.  
3. Connect to FlowLog-App for secure audit trail generation.  
4. Set up testing harness for adaptive load balancing and fault recovery.  
5. Establish trust root and update system for FlowScript signing.  

---

## Summary

The **FlowDirector** is the orchestrator of application-layer logic in the Flowgramming ecosystem.  
It ensures consistent, secure, and flexible execution of software instructions while offering **unparalleled transparency and adaptability**.
