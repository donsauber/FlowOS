**FlowSuites** 

**Orchestrated Script Chains for Modular Execution**

---

**Purpose:**  
 A FlowSuite is a structured collection of FlowScripts designed to operate as a coordinated unit. Rather than bundling all logic into a single monolithic FlowScript, FlowSuites allow for composability, modularity, and layered orchestration through a master controller known as a SuiteScript. This enables developers to create complex workflows, services, or even operating environments from small, manageable script units.

---

**Core Concepts:**

1. **SuiteScript (Master Controller)**

   * A SuiteScript is the entry point for a FlowSuite.

   * Responsible for loading, sequencing, configuring, and monitoring other FlowScripts.

   * May enforce global ActionTags, permissions, or resource limits across the suite.

   * May define suite-wide defaults for trust policies, logging behavior, and shared resource routing.

2. **Member FlowScripts**

   * Individual FlowScripts serve distinct roles and can be invoked by the SuiteScript or by one another.

Each script includes metadata to indicate suite membership:

 {  
  "suite\_id": "analytics/aggregate.v2",  
  "role": "aggregation",  
  "invoked\_by": "analytics/init.v2"  
}

*   
3. **Script Hierarchy & Structure**

   * Scripts may be arranged in layers or trees:

     * Sequential Chains (A → B → C)

     * Conditional Branches (A → B1 or B2 based on result)

     * Parallel Dispatch (A → \[B, C, D\] concurrently)

     * Fallback Chains (A → B; if B fails → C)

4. **Shared State & Data Coordination**

   * DataBlocks may be shared across multiple FlowScripts.

   * A special class of **SessionBlocks** can store context/state throughout suite execution.

   * CommBlocks coordinate inter-script messaging and relay control signals.

5. **Execution Isolation & Fault Control**

   * Each FlowScript retains its sandbox and trust scope.

   * SuiteScript handles fallback logic, quarantine, and dynamic rerouting.

   * FlowDirector logs the entire suite using a shared correlation ID.

6. **Adverb Propagation & Action Control**

   * Global ActionTags may be declared in the SuiteScript and passed down.

   * Specific FlowScripts may override with stricter tags if needed.

7. **Trust, Security, and Auditing**

   * A FlowSuite can include:

     * A suite-level signature or trust bundle

     * Suite-wide FlowGuard enforcement rules

     * FlowLog entries for each member script

   * A future **SuiteGuard** may allow hierarchical auditing and policy enforcement

---

**Common Use Cases:**

* Data pipelines: ingest → normalize → analyze → output → archive

* Modular applications: UI init → event monitor → task engine → logger

* Platform services: auth check → session load → route requests → return

* Boot sequences: environment check → device scan → system init → flow start

---

**Next Steps:**

* Define metadata schema for suite members

* Extend FlowDirector support for nested and parallel FlowScript management

* Define correlation token model for suite-level logging and auditing

* Introduce optional SuiteGuard subsystem for trust overlay and centralized controls

* Add Suite-level manifest format for packaging FlowSuites with versioning and constraints

FlowSuites enable scalable, modular, and secure construction of multi-script systems. They are foundational to extending Flowgramming into real-world orchestration of apps, agents, devices, and even OS functionality.
