**FlowLog-OS: Trusted Audit and Security Log for OSDirector**

---

**Purpose**:  
 FlowLog-OS is the cryptographically secure logging system used by OSDirector and FlowGuard-OS to track, verify, and audit all system-level operations. It serves as the foundational forensic record for trust decisions, boot sequences, DriverBlock execution, and KernelScript interpretation.

FlowLog-OS is never shared with user-space or application-level processes. It is maintained independently from FlowLog-App to ensure full compartmentalization of operating system security data.

**Core Responsibilities**:

1. **Immutable Logging**

   * All entries are cryptographically signed, timestamped, and hashed into a verifiable chain.

   * Each record includes a reference to the source (OSDirector, FlowGuard-OS, or DriverBlock).

   * Immutable storage ensures no tampering after recording.

2. **Validation Events**

   * Logs all KernelScript signature checks and boot approvals.

   * Logs each DriverBlock's load attempt, trust verification, sandbox check, or rejection.

   * Records any mismatches, untrusted sources, or blocked load attempts.

3. **Quarantine & Revocation Tracing**

   * Notes any quarantined DriverBlocks, trust list changes, or revoked components.

   * Includes cause, detection path, and correlation IDs for cross-reference with other systems.

4. **Manual Verification Reports**

   * When on-demand DriverBlock trust checks are run, logs the full report and hash outcome.

   * Marks manual vs. automatic verification distinctly.

5. **Provisioning Recordkeeping**

   * For IoT or Minimal Mode devices, logs the use of provisioning tokens and the trust baseline.

   * Records bootstrap conditions and any deviation from static trust assumptions.

6. **Cross-Domain Hooks (Optional)**

   * Can issue tokenized correlation hooks for FlowLog-App if cross-domain analysis is explicitly enabled.

   * This linkage is opt-in and does not expose any OS data by default.

7. **Log Export & Synchronization**

   * FlowLog-OS entries may be exported as signed bundles for:

     * Central audit servers

     * Forensic review

     * Regulatory compliance

   * Export format includes a manifest, hash list, and public signature block

8. **Error Monitoring & Alerting**

   * Abnormal patterns (e.g., frequent rejections, revoked drivers, conflicting KernelScripts) trigger alerts

   * Can escalate to a higher-level trust manager or external security node

**Log Structure** (Example Entry Schema)

{  
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T09:45:22Z",  
  "source": "FlowGuard-OS",  
  "action": "DriverBlock Load",  
  "driver\_id": "usb\_basic.v1.3",  
  "result": "verified",  
  "signature": "0xAF329...",  
  "hash": "0xD3E2...",  
  "correlation\_id": "kernelboot-44a1"  
}

---

**Next Steps**:

* Finalize the log schema for all OSDirector components

* Build export and bundling tool

* Design alerting and monitoring plugins for secure analysis

* Document retention, rotation, and review policies based on device class

FlowLog-OS is a required companion for FlowGuard-OS. It enables long-term trust enforcement and traceability while ensuring hardware, firmware, and driver interactions remain auditable and verifiable.
