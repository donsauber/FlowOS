# **FlowOS DataBlocks**

*Unified, Fractal Data Architecture*

---

## **1\. Overview**

**DataBlocks** are FlowOS’s universal containers for data, metadata, and state.  
 They behave like secure, self-describing folders that can hold anything from a single file to an entire dataset.  
 Each DataBlock knows:

* what it is

* where it came from

* how trustworthy it is

They scale fractally — the same design works for:

* enterprise databases

* department workspaces

* user sandboxes

* IoT NanoBlocks on sensors

---

## **2\. Fundamental Concepts**

| Concept | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **DataBlock** | Logical and physical container of data. |
| **DataSystem** | Runtime service governing access, trust, and lifecycle. |
| **Delta** | Recorded change within a DataBlock. |
| **FlowSig** | Compact, machine-readable fingerprint of current state. |
| **HealthBlock** | Tracks storage health and overflow risk. |
| **FlowGuard** | Manages keys, encryption, and permissions. |

---

## **3\. Structure of a DataBlock**

`/DataBlock/`  
   `manifest.yaml`  
   `data/`  
   `deltas/`  
   `state.current.db`  
   `state.detail.json`  
   `FlowDNA.sig`  
   `permissions.yaml`  
   `logs/`  
   `backups/`

### **Example Manifest**

`DataBlock:`  
  `id: "finance.sales"`  
  `version: "v2025.10"`  
  `role: "certified"`  
  `owner: "department:finance"`  
  `encryption: "AES-GCM"`  
  `trust_required: 90`  
  `storage_quota: 200GB`  
  `delta_policy: narrative`  
  `retention_days:`  
    `working: 14`  
    `departmental: 90`  
    `certified: 365`  
  `overflow_policy: downgrade`  
  `FlowSig:`  
    `value: "1F9KQb82Z+a7gE…"`  
    `type: "FlowSig-2"`

---

## **4\. Hierarchical Workflow**

Data ascends through trust layers:

`User Working Block → Department Block → Certified Block`

| Level | Purpose | Retention | Editable By |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **User / Working** | Sandbox for individuals or processes. | Short (days). | User or process. |
| **Department** | Validated collaborative data. | Medium (weeks). | Team leads, QA. |
| **Certified / Current State** | Approved snapshots. | Long (months–years). | System only. |

### **Promotion Job Example**

`jobs:`  
  `- name: settle_daily_finance`  
    `from: "user.*"`  
    `to: "certified.finance"`  
    `criteria:`  
      `- trust_score > 0.95`  
      `- review_approved == true`

---

## **5\. Deltas and Narratives**

Traditional systems store endless diffs; FlowOS stores **stories of change**.

| Mode | Behavior |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Narrative** | Summarizes net change. |
| **Hybrid** | Summaries plus key diffs. |
| **Full** | All raw changes retained. |

### **Delta Story Example**

`delta_story:`  
  `id: "finance_Q4"`  
  `period: "2025-10-01 – 2025-10-22"`  
  `summary: "3457 transactions reconciled; +4.2% revenue"`  
  `anomalies:`  
    `- "vendor_14 double entry"`  
  `trust_score: 0.97`  
  `detail_link: "sha256:abc123"`

---

## **6\. Current vs. Detailed State**

| File | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **state.current.db** | Lightweight SQL cache for runtime queries. |
| **state.detail.json** | Full historical metadata and lineage. |

Systems read *current* state for speed and update *detailed* state asynchronously.

---

## **7\. FlowSig: The Compressed Core**

Each block carries a short encoded fingerprint.

`FlowDNA:`  
  `FlowSig: "1F9KQb82Z+a7gE…"`  
  `type: "FlowSig-2"`  
  `generation: 17`  
  `parent: "sha256:abcd…"`

* Deterministic hash \+ compressed metadata bits

* Enables equality checks, caching, and IoT sync

* Edge Directors can roll up many FlowSigs into “super-signatures”

IoT NanoBlocks often transmit only the FlowSig unless a change occurs.

---

## **8\. DataSystem Duties**

* **Validation** – verify schema, trust, and lineage

* **Permission Enforcement** – via FlowGuard and Company Map Block

* **Lifecycle Management** – handle retention, compaction, overflow

* **Delta Summarization** – convert detailed diffs into stories

* **Backup & Recovery** – snapshot certified blocks; verify integrity

* **Overflow Response** – downgrade verbosity or move to cold storage

---

## **9\. Overflow and Backpressure**

If disk or network pressure rises:

1. Downgrade delta mode (`full → hybrid → narrative`)

2. Compress older deltas and snapshots

3. Temporarily mark as `read_only`

4. Write summary digests for continuity

All actions are logged in the HealthBlock.

---

## **10\. Permissions and Trust**

`permissions:`  
  `read: ["user:analyst_A","process:reporter"]`  
  `write: ["role:data_admin"]`  
  `manage: ["role:sys_admin"]`  
  `trust_required: 85`  
  `expiry: "2026-01-01"`

FlowGuard enforces these rules, verifying identity and trust before key release.

---

## **11\. Integration with Other Blocks**

| System | Role |
| ----- | ----- |
| **CommSystem** | Handles ingestion and API connections. |
| **ActionSystem** | Transforms and analyzes DataBlocks. |
| **Security Blocks** | Watch for tampering or anomalies. |
| **Performance Block** | Tracks data-handling efficiency. |
| **HealthBlock** | Monitors storage and latency. |
| **Analysis Block** | Visualizes deltas and trends. |

---

## **12\. IoT / NanoFlow Scaling**

Tiny devices run **NanoDataBlocks**.

`NanoDataBlock:`  
  `id: "sensor.temp_12"`  
  `datatype: "float"`  
  `history: 256`  
  `FlowSig: "AbC91…"`  
  `encryption: "AES-GCM"`

* Small ring buffer for last N readings

* Embedded FlowSig for state

* Edge Directors aggregate NanoFlow data into full DataBlocks

---

## **13\. Health and Self-Awareness**

`health:`  
  `size_mb: 183.2`  
  `growth_rate: "1.2%/day"`  
  `read_latency_ms: 12`  
  `overflow_risk: 0.08`  
  `last_compaction: "2025-10-20"`

Feeds into the system-wide HealthBlock for visibility.

---

## **14\. Narrative Example**

`story:`  
  `id: "datablock_finance_Q4"`  
  `summary: "Stable throughput. One minor ingestion delay corrected. No integrity issues."`  
  `trust_score: 0.99`  
  `size: "184 GB"`  
  `outlook: "Healthy"`

---

## **15\. Advantages**

| Feature | Benefit |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Fractal structure** | Same logic from IoT to enterprise. |
| **Adaptive verbosity** | Narrative ↔ Full modes save resources. |
| **Hierarchical governance** | User → Department → Certified ensures quality. |
| **FlowSig compression** | Enables millisecond comparisons and IoT sync. |
| **Security integration** | Built-in encryption, trust, and permissions. |
| **Self-health monitoring** | Prevents silent corruption. |
| **Readable \+ machine-friendly** | YAML for humans, FlowSig for machines. |

---

## **16\. Summary**

**DataBlocks are the living memory of FlowOS.**  
 They aren’t static files but evolving organisms that:

* learn from their changes

* summarize their own histories

* scale from a single sensor to an entire company

Readable like documents, verifiable like ledgers, and efficient like streams —  
 **DataBlocks form the backbone of FlowOS’s self-aware computing ecosystem.**
