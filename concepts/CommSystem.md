# CommBlocks & CommSystem  
**Communication Infrastructure in FlowOS**

---

## Purpose

The **CommBlock** and **CommSystem** together form the communication backbone of FlowOS.  
CommBlocks are modular containers that securely transmit data between FlowBlocks.  

The **CommSystem** is the centralized runtime layer that supports, validates, and governs all CommBlocks.  

This architecture enforces **security, trust, and system-wide visibility** across user input, APIs, inter-process messaging, and external network traffic.

## CommBlocks: Modular Communication Units

### What They Do
CommBlocks are runtime communication containers that:

- Route data between declared FlowBlocks  
- Validate and sanitize payloads  
- Log traffic behavior to FlowLog  
- Enforce protocol, trust, and traffic limits  
- Scale internally under load  
- Apply modular antivirus/malware templates  

They are declared explicitly in FlowScripts, which define:

- Number of instances  
- Connection endpoints  
- Security template  
- Trust threshold  
- Protocols or policies in use  

### What They Don’t Do
CommBlocks do **not**:

- Spawn new blocks  
- Create connections dynamically  
- Store persistent state  
- Modify FlowScripts  
- Execute unapproved logic  
- Elevate privileges  
- Handle networking directly

## CommSystem: Central CommBlock Management Layer

### Purpose
The **CommSystem** is a core component of FlowOS that manages all CommBlocks.  
It provides:

- **Routing validation** — ensures blocks only connect to allowed targets  
- **Security enforcement** — scans payloads, checks templates, denies spoofed traffic  
- **Template injection** — loads and distributes malware filters, AV rules, etc.  
- **Networking support** — interfaces with OS-level protocols securely  
- **DDoS and overload defense** — detects anomalies, throttles sources, reroutes  
- **Central observability** — logs all CommBlock behavior and alerts to FlowLog  
- **Trust validation** — checks source identity and scores interactions  

### Why This Matters
Without the CommSystem:

- Each CommBlock would need its own full AV/firewall stack  
- Attackers could misuse a CommBlock for unintended routing  
- User input, API calls, and network flows could become security risks  
- Logs and threat behavior would be fragmented  

With the CommSystem:

- All CommBlocks stay lean, focused, and consistent  
- Updates to policies and templates apply system-wide  
- External-facing inputs are sandboxed and pre-scanned  
- CommBlocks never directly trust their inputs — they rely on CommSystem clearance

## CommBlock Security Lifecycle

1. **FlowScript declaration:** Defines CommBlock ID and connection intent  
2. **CommSystem initialization:**
   - Loads the declared template  
   - Injects appropriate filters and trust policies  
   - Initializes the CommBlock under monitoring  
3. **Runtime operation:**
   - CommBlock passes all traffic through CommSystem scanning layers  
   - CommSystem monitors throughput, anomalies, and intent deviation  
4. **If compromised:**
   - CommSystem isolates the block  
   - FlowGuard is alerted  
   - FlowMemory records the event  
   - FlowLog tracks all context

## Example Use Cases

| Scenario | CommBlock Role | CommSystem Role |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| User uploads file | Sanitize and transmit file to parser Block | Scan for malware, verify MIME type, log fingerprint |
| API receives JSON | Validate schema and pass to Library Block | Rate-limit client, reject malformed payloads |
| Internal telemetry | Stream metrics from sensor Block to dashboard Block | Compress and filter based on policy |
| Peer-to-peer sync | Send data to external device | Encrypt channel, verify destination trust level |

---

## Template System (CommSystem-Controlled)

All CommBlocks receive templates from the CommSystem, such as:

- Threat signature databases  
- Payload sanitization rules  
- Format validators (e.g., JSON schema)  
- Protocol enforcement (e.g., UTF-8 only, no base64)  
- Rate-limiting and alert thresholds  

Templates are:

- Versioned  
- Signed  
- Replaceable mid-execution  
- Trust-scored by FlowMemory  
- Deployable via FlowTrustNet
