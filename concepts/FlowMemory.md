**FlowMemory**

**Adaptive Trust and Behavioral Recall System for FlowOS**

---

**Overview:**  
 FlowMemory is the internal memory, feedback, and judgment engine of FlowOS. It underpins the operating system’s ability to learn over time, detect recurring threats, reward stability, and establish adaptive trust across FlowBlocks, Scripts, and external systems.

Where FlowLog records *what happened*, and FlowGuard acts on *what's wrong*, FlowMemory decides *what to expect next*—and what *should* be trusted.

---

**Core Functions of FlowMemory:**

1. **Trust Scoring & Decay**

   * Assigns trust scores to:

     * ActionBlocks

     * FlowScripts

     * Comm endpoints (API targets, devices, IPs)

     * External Package Sources

   * Trust increases from successful, sandbox-clean executions.

   * Trust decays over time unless reaffirmed.

   * Negative events (flagged logs, crashes, corruption, performance issues) trigger score drops or quarantine.

2. **Pattern Memory**

   * Records patterns of:

     * Commonly connected Blocks

     * Input/output behavior

     * Success under different Adverb Tags

   * Allows FlowOS to optimize future load balancing, block spawning, and trust propagation.

3. **Threat Recall**

   * Maintains history of:

     * Past malware signatures

     * Behavioral flags

     * Bad sandboxed experiments

   * Works with FlowGuard to quarantine new Blocks that resemble old threats.

4. **Reputation Coordination**

   * Syncs with FlowNet feeds for:

     * Trusted publisher metadata

     * Public flagging reports

     * Regional or geopolitical threat zones

   * Allows FlowOS to shift local policy based on emerging global consensus.

5. **Source Profiling**

   * Tracks reliability of sources:

     * Per Action or Package Source

     * Per user or script origin

   * Adjusts risk score of new blocks by origin type.

6. **Trust Inheritance for Forked Scripts**

   * When FlowScripts call child scripts:

     * Can inherit trust budget from parent

     * Trust history can travel across Suite layers

---

**Security Features:**

* Trust logic is never externally writable—only internally learned or FlowGuard-influenced.

* Can operate in "Paranoid Mode" (no inheritance, no trust persistence).

* FlowMemory entries are versioned and logged internally.

* Quarantines can be auto-triggered from trust scores alone.

---

**Key Integration Points:**

* **FlowGuard-App/OS**: Alerts FlowMemory on threat detection.

* **FlowLog-App/OS**: Feeds success/failure patterns into trust scoring.

* **FlowDirector**: Queries FlowMemory for allowed/spawnable Blocks.

* **Package Managers**: Filter installs or upgrades based on trust memory.

* **CommSystem**: Monitors endpoints and throttles risky connections.

---

**Design Goals:**

* Decentralized learning: Each FlowOS instance develops its own trust history.

* Shareable memory fragments: Trust profiles can be exported/imported (opt-in).

* Modular memory layers: OS-level vs. App-level memory separation.

* Minimal false positives: Every judgment is logged and reviewable.

FlowMemory makes FlowOS adaptive—not merely reactive—by allowing it to remember, compare, and gradually shift behavior. It's what allows a Flow system to stop asking "is this allowed?" and start answering "should I trust this—based on everything I’ve seen before?"
