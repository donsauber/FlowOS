**FlowGuard-OS: Design Overview and Specification**

---

**Purpose**:  
 FlowGuard-OS is the dedicated security subsystem that enforces trust policies, signature validation, behavioral restrictions, and audit logging for the OSDirector. It is responsible for validating KernelScripts, DriverBlocks, and all related low-level system components. It protects the boot process, manages sandbox security at the OS level, and handles long-term auditability and forensic readiness.

---

**Core Responsibilities**:

1. **KernelScript Validation**

   * Enforces strict signature checks before executing any KernelScript.

   * Optionally checks script hashes against a trusted allowlist.

   * Can reject, quarantine, or escalate KernelScripts with unknown or revoked signatures.

2. **DriverBlock Trust Management**

   * Validates signatures on all DriverBlocks prior to activation.

   * Performs static and optional dynamic checks on DriverBlocks before loading.

   * Maintains a signed trust database of approved, denied, and provisionally-allowed drivers.

3. **On-Demand Verification API**

   * Users or the OSDirector may invoke a manual trust check on any DriverBlock.

   * Process includes signature verification, capability scan, and optional sandbox simulation.

   * Results are logged to FlowLog-OS and returned as a signed attestation.

4. **Quarantine & Revocation**

   * If malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, FlowGuard-OS can quarantine the driver, revoke trust, or flag it for manual investigation.

   * All actions are recorded in FlowLog-OS.

5. **Audit Logging to FlowLog-OS**

   * Every decision, validation, failure, quarantine, or override is logged.

   * Logs are cryptographically signed and indexed.

   * Logs include correlation tokens for potential cross-domain tracing.

6. **Policy Updates**

   * FlowGuard-OS can ingest policy updates, either local or from a curated FlowTrustExchange.

   * All updates must be signed and verified against OSDirector trust roots.

7. **Provisioning Mode for IoT**

   * In IoT deployments without auto-update, FlowGuard-OS operates in Minimal Mode.

   * Accepts only pre-signed KernelScripts and DriverBlocks along with a provisioning token.

   * Trusts are static unless re-flashed or re-signed by a known provisioning authority.

8. **Security Domain Isolation**

   * FlowGuard-OS is strictly isolated from FlowGuard-App.

   * Logs are written to FlowLog-OS and never expose data to FlowLog-App.

   * Communication between domains is brokered through a CrossDomainBroker and subject to policy.

---

**Next Steps for Implementation**:

* Define the JSON schema for FlowLog-OS entries.

* Create policy templates for different device types (desktop, server, IoT, restricted).

* Design the CrossDomainBroker protocol.

* Build initial tests for DriverBlock sandbox behavior and signature verification.

* Design default provisioning token format and trust bootstrapping method.

This document can be included as a subsystem module inside the OSDirector file. It assumes FlowGuard-OS is loaded as a core service by the KernelScript.
